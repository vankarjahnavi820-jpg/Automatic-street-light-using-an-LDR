# Automatic Street Light using LDR

This project automatically turns ON the LED when it gets dark and turns it OFF during daylight using an LDR sensor. 
It helps in saving electricity by controlling the light based on ambient light intensity.

## Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- LDR Sensor
- IR Sensor (optional)
- LED or bulb
- Resistors and wires

## Working
- The LDR detects the amount of light.
- When the light level falls below a threshold (nighttime), the Arduino turns ON the LED.
- When light increases (daytime), the LED turns OFF automatically.
